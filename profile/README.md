> “Every wave carries a memory. This is one of them.”

**Remiora** is a movement.  
A creative technology studio conjuring **immersive experiences, poetic games, and interactive shrines**.

This organization is the home of everything flowing beneath the name Remiora —  
from the ethereal core website [remiora.com](https://remiora.com),  
to future **interactive albums**, **ritual-based microgames**, and **experimental digital art**.

## What Is Remiora?

Remiora is a **world**.

It spans:
- 🎭 **Interactive art** that breathes like a dream
- 🐚 **Website-experiences** that reject modernism in favor of mysticism
- 🎮 **Small games** and narrative experiments
- 🧪 **Explorations** in interaction, sound, and visual language

It started with Remiora’s world — and continues to grow into something stranger. Remiora is a creative system — part identity, part expanding archive of experimental work.

## ✨ Creative Ethos

Remiora is shaped by a few simple ideas:

1. 🌘 **Web experiences can carry meaning**  
   Not everything needs to be efficient. Some things are meant to be felt.

2. 🪞 **Beauty comes before convention**  
   We’d rather build something strange and alive than follow the rules.

3. 🧬 **Emotion is part of the structure**  
   The way something looks, moves, or sounds is part of what it says.
